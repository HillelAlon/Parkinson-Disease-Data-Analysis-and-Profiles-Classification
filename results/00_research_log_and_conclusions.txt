=== PARKINSON'S RESEARCH PROJECT: AUTOMATED SUMMARY ===
Hypothesis: Parkinson's symptoms follow unique, dissociated trajectories per patient.

[Step 1] Cleaning Raw Data...

Filtered 1304 diagnosed patients.
Executing clinical metric dissociation analysis.

[Step 3] Running PCA & Unsupervised Clustering...
Dataset loaded successfully. Shape: (1304, 12)
Feature scaling complete: Data transformed into Z-scores.
PCA completed. Dimensionality reduced to 3. Total Variance: 28.39%
Variance Breakdown - PC1: 9.89%, PC2: 9.42%, PC3: 9.08%
Clustering Complete. Patients per Profile:

Cluster
3    340
1    326
0    326
2    312
Name: count, dtype: int64

Profiles summarized and exported to CSV.

[Step 4] Statistical Cluster Validation (ANOVA Results):
One-way analysis of variance
H0: Samples in all groups are drawn from populations with the same mean values.
 Our critical P-value (alpha): 0.2
(We teke this p_value because the data is synthetic...)

UPDRS
F-statistic: 0.613
P-value: 0.607
Not significant, we cannot reject the null hypothesis.

MoCA
F-statistic: 0.691
P-value: 0.557
Not significant, we cannot reject the null hypothesis.

FunctionalAssessment
F-statistic: 1.592
P-value: 0.19
Significant! We can reject the null hypothesis.
We need to do a Post hoc analysis.
We pick to do 'Pairwise comparisons': Tests all possible pairs.
Don't forget to counteract the multiple comparisons problem.
So we are doing the 'Bonferroni correction'
Our new critical P-value (alpha): 0.033
We need to divide this by two because the test is two-tailed.
Our new critical P-value (alpha): 0.017
0,1: 0.098
Not significant.
0,2: 0.115
Not significant.
0,3: 0.812
Not significant.
1,2: 0.959
Not significant.
1,3: 0.136
Not significant.
2,3: 0.158
Not significant.


One way analysis of variance complete.
